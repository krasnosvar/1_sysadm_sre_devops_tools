# Vagrantfile to create a CentOS 7 master and 3 nodes
#
# These VMs can be useful for prototyping new systems such
# as monitoring, mail, configuration management, load balancing
# etc etc.
#
# You will need a Puppet directory structure inside the
# project directory: ./puppet/environments/vagrant/
#
# Requires the following Vagrant plugins:
#   vagrant-puppet-install
#   vagrant-vbguest
#   vagrant-hosts
#
# The above plugins should work just fine on
# Windows 10 as of 2017-08-25
#
# anthonyclarka2 AT G MAIL
#
# Once complete, you should have 1 large "master" VM
# and 3 smaller "node" VMs running CentOS 7 latest.
# They will all have a second, host-only network with
# address 10.0.3.0/24 with addresses as follows:
#
# master = 10.0.3.10
# nodeX = 10.0.3.10X
#
# VMs can thus talk to each other, and you can SSH
# into them directly
#
