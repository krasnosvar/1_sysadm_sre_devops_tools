In Go 1.24 (and since Go 1.11), you typically don't use GOPATH anymore. 
Go modules are the standard way to manage dependencies.


Recommendation: Use Go modules (default in Go 1.24). 
Only use GOPATH if you're maintaining old legacy code that requires it.

Quick check what mode you're in:
```
go env GO111MODULE  # "on" = modules, "off" = GOPATH, "" = auto
```

If GOPATH environment variable is not set. Let's check where Go is actually storing modules:
Check the actual module cache location
```
go env GOMODCACHE
```
